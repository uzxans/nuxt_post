*  - `url.pathname`
*  - `url.search`
*  - `url.searchParams`
*  - `url.protocol`
*
* **NOTES:**
*
* - It is assumed that the input URL is **already encoded** and formatted from an HTTP request and contains no hash.
* - Triggering the setters or getters on other props will deoptimize to full URL parsing.
* - Changes to `searchParams` will be discarded as we don't track them.
